Supplier master screen not be required as of now, lets go with the Goods received details alone, will take it up later when it is raised from customer.
Have the above 2 tables to start with.
Goods recieved master screen may be like this....

Supplier id (search from supplier master)		Part Number		Part Description


GIN No							Date			Quantity


							Submit Button

Below the screen display the earlier goods recieved (recently received 10 records), with edit and print option in the table format.

On click of print icon in the grid, bring the label screen which is given in whatsapp image.

so it will be just 2 screens to meet this requirement. hope this is clear, let us talk if needed more clarity.
